## AI Assistant

The application features a powerful AI assistant powered by Google's Vertex AI that can help you manage your notes through natural language commands.

### Key AI Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Interact with your notes using everyday language.
- **Multi-Action Support**: The AI can process and execute multiple actions in a single message (e.g., create, search, count, update, delete, complete, restore).
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Find notes even if you don't remember the exact titleâ€”partial and similar matches are supported.
- **Interactive Selection**: If multiple notes match your request, the AI will list them and let you pick the correct one by replying with a number.
- **Note Restoration**: Restore deleted notes by name or bring back the most recently deleted note.
- **Q&A Over Notes**: Ask questions about the content of a note (e.g., "What does the note titled 'recipes' say about ingredients?") and get intelligent answers.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands your notes' content and context, and can guide you to clarify vague requests.
- **Smart Confirmation**: For destructive actions like deleting all notes, the AI will ask for confirmation.
- **Usage Limits**: Enforces daily message and token limits to ensure fair usage.

### Advanced Example Commands

Here are some advanced ways to interact with the AI assistant:

#### Fuzzy Matching & Interactive Selection

Please reply with the number of the note you want to update."

# You reply:
"2"
# The AI updates the second note.
```
